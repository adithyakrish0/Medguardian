# 🎬 MedGuardian Demo Script

**Goal:** Record a 2-3 minute video that proves this is a "Deep Tech" project, not just a web app.

## Scene 1: The "Hook" (Voice Control)
*Start at the Dashboard (Dark Mode).*
1.  **Action**: Don't touch the mouse. Say: *"Hey Guardian, do I have any meds?"*
2.  **System**: "You have X medications...".
3.  **Action**: Say: *"Scan medication"*.
4.  **System**: Navigates to the camera page (without you clicking).
5.  **Voiceover**: "MedGuardian uses a local Neuro-Symbolic intent parser. No cloud APIs, zero latency privacy-first voice control."

## Scene 2: The "Tech" (Computer Vision)
*On the Verification Page.*
1.  **Action**: Hold up a pill bottle (or any object you registered).
2.  **Action**: Click "Verify".
3.  **Result**: Show the green "Verified" checkmark.
4.  **Voiceover**: "Our Vision V2 engine combines YOLO-World with ORB feature matching to prevent false positives. It checks color histograms and text labels in real-time."

## Scene 3: The "Science" (Bio-Digital Twin)
*Navigate back to Analytics Dashboard.*
1.  **Action**: Scroll to the "Bio-Digital Twin" chart (the blue curve).
2.  **Voiceover**: "This isn't just a log. This is a Pharmacokinetic Simulation. We use First-Order Elimination calculus to model the actual drug concentration in the patient's blood."
3.  **Point**: Hover over the curve. Show the "Optimal" vs "Sub-Therapeutic" zones.
4.  **Voiceover**: "This helps caregivers see if a missed dose is actually dangerous based on the drug's biological half-life."

## Scene 4: The "Intelligence" (Predictive ML)
*Scroll to the "Next-Dose Forecast" card.*
1.  **Action**: Highlight the risk score.
2.  **Voiceover**: "Finally, our Random Forest classifier predicts non-adherence before it happens, allowing for proactive intervention."

## Closing
*Return to Dashboard.*
"MedGuardian: From Reactive Logging to Proactive Biological Intelligence."
